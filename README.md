- Download the ZIP archive for Windows.
- Unzip the downloaded archive to a safe and convenient location on your computer (eg:  `C:\Java\jdk-24`).
- Locate the `java.exe` file inside the extracted folder (typically in the `bin` directory).
- Copy the full path to the `bin` folder.
- Add this path to your system's **PATH** environment variable:
  - Open the **Start Menu** and search for `Environment Variables`.
  - Click **"Edit the system environment variables"**.
  - In the **System Properties** window, click **"Environment Variables..."**.
  - Under **System Variables**, select **Path** and click **Edit**.
